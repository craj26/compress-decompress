We are starting with the session !!For Additional Functionality:
CompressDecompress: 
1. Let user know whats the size of file user is trying to compress and whats the compressed size.
2. Allow user to provide the extension to which user wants to decompress the file to.
3. Try implementing algorithms like huffman encoding and decoding algorithm to encode and decode the files and add the functionality to encode/decode in your project.
For file compressor/decompressor, you can refer to these points to be added in resume / github :

- Made a GUI to compress a txt file into gzip file and decode the encoded txt file (compressed into gzip file).
- Was able to compress a file of size __ to ___ .
- Made the GUI using java swing and awt.

Hi Guys, we will be starting with the session on Minor Project 2 at 3:00pm
Hi Guys, we will be starting in a couple of minutes.
We are starting with the session !!For Additional Functionality:
CompressDecompress: 
1. Let user know whats the size of file user is trying to compress and whats the compressed size.
2. Allow user to provide the extension to which user wants to decompress the file to.
3. Try implementing algorithms like huffman encoding and decoding algorithm to encode and decode the files and add the functionality to encode/decode in your project.
For file compressor/decompressor, you can refer to these points to be added in resume / github :

- Made a GUI to compress a txt file into gzip file and decode the encoded txt file (compressed into gzip file).
- Was able to compress a file of size __ to ___ .

CompressDecompress: 
1. Let user know whats the size of file user is trying to compress and whats the compressed size.
2. Allow user to provide the extension to which user wants to decompress the file to.
3. Try implementing algorithms like huffman encoding and decoding algorithm to encode and decode the files and add the functionality to encode/decode in your project.
For file compressor/decompressor, you can refer to these points to be added in resume / github :

- Made a GUI to compress a txt file into gzip file and decode the encoded txt file (compressed into gzip file).
- Was able to compress a file of size __ to ___ .
- Made the GUI using java swing and awt.
